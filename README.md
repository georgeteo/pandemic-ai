# Pandemic Ai

I aim to make a [Pandemic boardgame](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) playing AI using Google [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and Reinforcement Learning. Some of the architecture has been inspired by [this example](https://github.com/nivwusquorum/tensorflow-deepq) on Github. However, unlike DeepMind's work training a generalized Atari AI using ConvNets, I have a much more modest goal of training an AI specifically to play Pandemic using RNN and human selected features.
